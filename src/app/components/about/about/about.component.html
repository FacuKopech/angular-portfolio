    <h2>About <span class="spanTxt">Me</span></h2>
    <p>My name is Facundo Kopech. I'm 25 years old and I graduated as a Software Engineer in December, 2024.
      I'm both a Frontend and Backend developer, but I am looking forward to grow as a Frontend dev, given that
      with the experience I had I noticed that I highly prefer this field for my development career.
      I started working as a developer at the age of 19 under the position of web developer, with a primary focus
      on Backend. My very first developer position was in Softing S.R.L, followed by Municipal Bank of Rosario, and finally,
      now I am working at Southworks, as a Software Engineer.
      All of these experiences allowed me to grow and learn a variety of technologies and methodologies.
      This is why right now I have a clear goal, which is to deepen my knowledge in FrontEnd technologies and
      become a Senior Full-Stack developer.
      I consider myself hard worker, responsible and always wanting to learn more about the technologies I'm
      interested in. I'm looking for a company which would give me the opportunity to grow in everything related to FrontEnd, which is
      my motivation to be looking for this change.
      That being said, I appreciate very much your time for reading about me and my professional interests.</p>
